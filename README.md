# manojitnath.com — Personal Cybersecurity Blog - WIP

This is the source code for [manojitnath.com](https://manojitnath.com), my personal blog where I share my learnings, career insights, hands-on labs, and articles about topics I find interesting.

This Site is Built with:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) — Static site generator
- Git + [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) — Hosting
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — Markdown writing workflow

---

The Hugo code has been custom-written and tailored to my preferences. This repository is not intended to be used as a theme or starter template. However, I encourage others to take inspiration from this project and build their own personal blog
