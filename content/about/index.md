Hi, I'm Manojit. I've spent the last 10 years in cybersecurity helping organizations manage risk, maintain compliance, and strengthen their security posture. Currently, I work as a Cyber Risk and Strategy Consultant at Deloitte USI.

My background spans defensive cybersecurity, including incident response, threat detection, network and system security. I have also performed ISO 27001 implementation and internal audits, managed vulnerability management programs, conducted NIST CSF based assessments, along with cyber risk and maturity assessments across industry standards and regulations.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into threat modeling and cloud security, areas I find both challenging and rewarding.

This site is where I document my journey. I share practical notes from my study and research, write technical articles about topics I find interesting, and post cybersecurity tutorials to help others on a similar path.

Outside of work, I live a simple life. I enjoy traveling, exploring new ideas and technologies, playing guitar now and then, and spending quality time with my wonderful wife and daughter.
