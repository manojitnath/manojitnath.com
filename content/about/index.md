Hi, I'm Manojit. I've spent the last 10 years in cybersecurity helping organizations manage risk, maintain compliance, and strengthen their security posture. Currently, I work as a Cyber Risk and Strategy Consultant at Deloitte USI.

This site is where I document my journey. I share notes from my studies, research and personal reflections. Write technical articles on topics I find interesting, and publish hands-on cybersecurity labs and tutorials to help others on a similar path.

Outside of work, I live a simple life. I enjoy traveling (something I definitely need to do more of), I like exploring new ideas and technologies, playing guitar now and then, and spending quality time with my wonderful wife and daughter.

## My Core Competencies

IT Governance, Risk and Compliance, ISO 27001 Implementation & Audit, NIST CSF, Vulnerability Management, Risk Management and Cyber Maturity Assessments across industry standards and regulations.
