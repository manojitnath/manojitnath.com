+++

DevSecOps is widely discussed but rarely implemented well.

Most failures are not technical — they are organizational.

## Security as a Bottleneck

Security teams often become reviewers instead of enablers.

## Automation Without Ownership

Automating broken processes only scales dysfunction.

## A More Practical Model

DevSecOps works when security owns guardrails, not approvals.
